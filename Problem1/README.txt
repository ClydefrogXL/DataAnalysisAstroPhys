Naming:
modules                         should have short, all-lowercase names
class                           names should be in the CapWords style
variables and function names    should be lowercase_with_underscores
constants                       should be CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES
names that would clash with Python keywords (such as 'class' or 'if') should have a trailing underscore
